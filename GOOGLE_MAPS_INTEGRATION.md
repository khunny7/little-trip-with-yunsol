# Google Maps API Integration Guide

## Overview

This project now includes a proper Google Maps API integration that displays all places with addresses on a single interactive map, replacing the previous iframe-based implementation that showed only one place at a time.

## Features

✅ **Multi-marker display**: Shows all places with addresses simultaneously on one map  
✅ **Interactive markers**: Click markers to see place details in info windows  
✅ **Custom marker styling**: Branded markers with place icons  
✅ **Automatic bounds fitting**: Map adjusts to show all places optimally  
✅ **Place selection**: Clicking place cards or markers highlights and focuses them  
✅ **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when API key is missing or invalid  
✅ **Geocoding**: Converts addresses to coordinates automatically  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Google Maps API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the "Maps JavaScript API" for your project
4. Create an API key in the Credentials section
5. (Optional) Restrict the API key to your domain for security

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Google Maps API Key
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.env.example` file shows the required format.

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the map view in the application
3. Verify that all places with addresses appear as markers on the map

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- **GoogleMapsView.jsx**: Core Google Maps component with multi-marker support
- **MapView.jsx**: Updated to use GoogleMapsView instead of iframe embed
- **@googlemaps/js-api-loader**: Official Google Maps JavaScript API loader

### Key Features

```jsx
// Example usage
<GoogleMapsView
  places={placesWithAddress}
  selectedPlace={selectedPlace}
  onPlaceSelect={handlePlaceSelect}
  height="500px"
/>
```

### Error Handling

The component includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Missing API key**: Shows clear error message with setup instructions
- **Network issues**: Graceful fallback with retry mechanism
- **Invalid coordinates**: Skips places that can't be geocoded
- **API quota exceeded**: Displays appropriate error message

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy loading**: Maps only load when the component is rendered
- **Geocoding caching**: Coordinates are cached per session
- **Bounds optimization**: Automatically fits all markers in view
- **Marker clustering**: Ready for future implementation if needed

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Iframe-based)
- ❌ Showed only one place at a time
- ❌ Required navigation between places
- ❌ Limited interactivity
- ❌ No custom styling
- ❌ No API key required (but limited functionality)

### After (Google Maps API)
- ✅ Shows all places simultaneously
- ✅ Interactive markers and info windows
- ✅ Full Google Maps functionality
- ✅ Custom branding and styling
- ✅ Proper API integration with error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Map shows error message
- Verify your API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Check that "Maps JavaScript API" is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure your API key has proper permissions
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### No markers appear
- Verify places have valid address fields
- Check that geocoding is working (console logs will show errors)
- Ensure network connectivity to Google Maps API

### Performance issues
- Consider implementing marker clustering for large datasets
- Check API usage quotas in Google Cloud Console
- Monitor geocoding requests (limited to places with addresses)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

- **Marker clustering**: Group nearby places to reduce clutter
- **Custom map styling**: Apply custom colors and themes
- **Route planning**: Show directions between multiple places
- **Offline support**: Cache map tiles for offline viewing
- **Advanced filtering**: Toggle place types directly on the map

## Security Notes

- Always restrict your API key to specific domains in production
- Monitor API usage to prevent unexpected charges
- Consider implementing rate limiting for geocoding requests
- Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code

The new Google Maps integration provides a much better user experience while maintaining all existing functionality from the previous implementation.
